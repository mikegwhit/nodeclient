"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" NodeClient Classes FileHelpersFilesFileScanner ncli-core-files 0.6.6 FilesRecursive filename retrieval using the node_modules filesystem. Includes FileWriter and utility functions. Files are delivered first from node_modules, then from subfolder packages, then from the executing package. Example UsageUse require('ncli-core-files').readFiles(fromFolder); to retrieve an array listing of files in the fromFolder subfolder. Reads occur in the executing package, subpackages of the executing package and the node_modules diretory. require('ncli-core-files') behaviorExports a Files class instantiation. Dependencies Name Description chalk Creates pretty error messages. fs-extra Moves files. rimraf Removes directories and subdirectories in one call. stack-trace Gets filename of currently executing function's caller. File ContextsThere are five file contexts. Name Description Example Local The filesystem relative to which file was called when executing Node. node index.js Script The filesystem relevant to the first non-node_modules folder with a package.json the executing script. node_modules/bin/foobar Global Script The filesystem relevant to the first non-node_modules folder with a package.json relative to the current working directory associated with the Node process. /usr/local/lib/foobar %AppData%/npm/foobar node_modules Package The filesystem relevant to a package relative to the currently executing file. Looked up by package name as defined by folder name directly in node_modules folder. node_modules/foo/bar.js Local Package The filesystem relevant to a package relative to the currently executing file. Looked up by package name as defined by name field in package.json file. Requires a local file scan of packages. foo/bar.txt * foo/package.json FileHelpers ClassStatic container class. Solves common use cases for interacting with a Node.js development filesystem. Brings various dependencies into one place. Change directory to originally executed filepath. Get the most relevant package.json name field given a file. Get first folder not contained in a node_modules path if executing from a node_modules context. Given some filepath, find all package.json files not contained in a node_modules file tree. Resolve absolute file paths given a PackgeName/File format when local use and package use is desired. FileScanner ClassProvides file reading helperes for local and package contexts. Additionally provides interface for whitelisting and blacklisting packages. FileWriter ClassProvides file writing helpers for writing files to local and package contexts.Writes files irrespective of file path existing (i.e. creates folders).Manages temporary files (i.e. removes on process exit). Moves files in bulk. Index release/postinstall.js Builds the cache for both the package index AND the files index for all packages. Index release/safeinstall.js This file combats weird NPM and Yarn errors relating to local filesystem lib. What it does is delete the lock files, redownload the dependencies IN ORDER such that the lowest dependency is rebuilt first. It seemed like once a low-level dependency had been corrupted other installs would fail. This script solves for that. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-29T15:18:20-06:00 using the DocStrap template.

Includes finding first non-node_modules folder, the original executed file, the current functions parent file, all packages in a directory, resolving packageName/file paths. new FileHelpers() Methods &lt;static&gt; findPackageDirectories(from, cache, ignoreNodeModules) Given some root directory, finds all package.json files outside of node_modules paths. Parameters: Name Type Default Description from String (Optional) If provided, the root directory from which to search. Else, uses process.cwd(). cache Boolean false If true, caches the results and returns from cache if cache hits. ignoreNodeModules Boolean true Ignores the node_modules packages. Setting this to true might take a really long time! Returns: An array of package directories. Type Array &lt;static&gt; findPackageNames(from, cache) Finds the packages given a directory. Parameters: Name Type Default Description from String (Optional) If provided, the root directory from which to search. Else, uses process.cwd(). cache Boolean false If true, caches the results and returns from cache if cache hits. Returns: An object of package directories, keyed by package name. Type Object &lt;static&gt; findPackages(from, cache, ignoreNodeModules) Given some root directory, finds all package.json files outside of node_modules paths. Parameters: Name Type Default Description from String (Optional) If provided, the root directory from which to search.

Setting this to true might take a really long time! &lt;static&gt; getApplicationDirectory(from) Gets the most relevant application directory. This is defined by taking the currently executing file folder, and checking or moving up until the directory is no longer inside a node_modules folder. Parameters: Name Type Description from String (Optional) If provided, attempts to lookup from the from directory. Returns: The most relevant application directory. Type string &lt;static&gt; getCallerFile() Gets the caller function's filename. Assumes called function is one function above Console.getCallerFile function. Author: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16697791/nodejs-get-filename-of-caller-function Returns: The called function filename. Type String &lt;static&gt; getCallerFiles() Gets the caller function's filename. Assumes called function is one function above Console.getCallerFile function. Author: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16697791/nodejs-get-filename-of-caller-function Returns: The callstack. Type Array &lt;static&gt; getFile(file) Gets a file by resolving a packageName/path format and ensuring the current working directory is at the 'package.json' root. This allows for files to be gotten from their most relevant path and also allows for path reuse even when a file is available as a package only (via node_modules). Parameters: Name Type Description file String The package file to get. Returns: The filepath or false if no file found. Type Boolean | String &lt;static&gt; getMainDirectory() Heuristic for guessing main directory. This includes resolving the following use cases: 1) ./node_modules/.bin scripts 2) ./node_modules/PACKAGE_NAME/file scripts 3) ./SUBDIR/file calls The first non-node_modules folder with a package.json in it is used. &lt;static&gt; getNodeModulePackages(progress) Gets all node_modules packages. Parameters: Name Type Default Description progress function false (Optional) If provided, is pinged when each package is scanned. &lt;static&gt; getPackageDirectory() Gets the directory of a package. &lt;static&gt; getPackageFile(file) Gets the package.json given a file path.

Type Boolean | String &lt;static&gt; getPackageName(file) Gets the package.json name key given a file path. If not found in the filepath directory, moves up a directory.
