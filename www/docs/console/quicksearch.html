Messages are displayed with the following format: [PackageName] [Error|Info|Log|Warning] Log Message. For example, an error message might look like this: [ncli-server] [Error] User received 500 error. Console also enables whitelisting/blacklisting, log redirection, and console summaries. Having Fun with EmojiWith the introduction of unicode emoji, you can now write fun console and log messages! Since NPM does not allow emoji in package names, you can add these emoji safely to your package name using the friendlyName key in your package.json file. See a full emoji list here: https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.htmlUsing the friendlyName field, all console messages occurring within the package will be printed using the friendlyName which can include emoji. Configs Name Description Default blacklist Package names to blacklist from displaying console messages. By default, squelched packages are redirected to logs. Wildcards may be used to match multiple packages. [&quot;&quot;] loggingMode Either file or package. Currently only supports package logging. package summary Package names to summarize. Wildcards may be used to match multiple packages. [&quot;&quot;] summaryInterval Package names to summarize. Wildcards may be used to match multiple packages. 30000 thresholdCooldown After throttling has occurred, number of milliseconds before a log count is decreased. 150 thresholdCount The number of log messages to trigger throttling. 2 whitelist Package names on the whitelist are not subject to throttling.

"},"Console.html":{"id":"Console.html","title":"Class: Console","body":" NodeClient Classes Console Class: Console Console Console provides console throttling and blacklisting/whitelisting support. Provides standardized formatting for console messages. Summary mode supplies a regular summary of how many and what type of log messages occurred for each package. If a package is on blacklist, the console messages are always logged. If on the whitelist, the console messages are always displayed. If on the summary list, the messages are logged and summarized. Only if console.logWhitelist is true, then whitelisted packages are logged to the filesystem. If a package is on none of the lists, then it is subject to throttling heuristics. Blacklisting and whitelisting may be applied to subfolders. A whitelisted match always has higher priority than a blacklist match. new Console() To Do: Provide squelching of child threads. Add throttling such that summaries are displayed. Members blacklist The blacklisted packages are never shown in the console. class Just a reference to the class for static members access. fileStates :Object Stores the state of each file or grouping, including number of logs, whether or not the file has been throttled, and the throttle start time. Type: Object packageStates :Object Stores the state of each package. Stores similar information to fileStates, but for entire package. Type: Object whitelist The whitelisted packages are always shown in the console. Methods &lt;static&gt; error() Logs an error message. &lt;static&gt; info() Logs an info message. &lt;static&gt; isListed() Returns: True if the package is on the list. Used for whitelist, blacklist, summary list checks. Type Boolean &lt;static&gt; log(message, level, packageName, filename) Log a message. Displays a formatted log message. Gets to this only if packageName is not blacklisted or explicitly invoked. Parameters: Name Type Description message String The message to log. level String The level of log, could be info|log|warn|error. packageName String The package name logging. If no packageName supplied, then find package. filename String The filename logging. If no filename supplied, then find filename. &lt;static&gt; restoreConsole() Restores the original console functions. &lt;static&gt; warn() Logs an warn message. addToWhitelist() Adds to the whitelist. checkThrottled(packageName, filename) Checks if a file has been throttled for output. Parameters: Name Type Description packageName String The package name to check. filename String Input filename to check for. To Do: Add support for file-level throttling. Returns: Returns true if filename is throttled. Type Boolean getDefaultStateObject() Returns the default state of a file. incrementCounter(packageName, filename, throttled) Increments counter each time a console message is logged, storing the counter by a particular file. Parameters: Name Type Default Description packageName String The package to increment for. filename String The file to increment for. throttled Boolean false If true, increment the throttled counts. initializeThresholds() Sets the amount of logging tolerated per file given a duration. If a file is spamming console, then a consolidated error message will be displayed as an alternative. overrideConsole() Override the console functions. This includes a throttle check and a removeFromWhitelist() Removes from the whitelist. resetStates() Resets all file and package counters. restoreConsole() Restores the original console functions. storeLog(packageName, filename, args, level) Stores a log to the logger service. Indicates an object containing the type as console, args as what was sent to the console, and the filename where the message originated. Parameters: Name Type Default Description packageName String The package being logged for. filename String The filename being stored for. args Array The arguments passed to the console. level String info The level of log, could be info|log|warn|error. throttleOutput() Outputs buffered console content previously throttled. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-09-25T05:26:39-06:00 using the DocStrap template.
