Guide: Integrating shutdown sequence with your systemShutting down the Node.js process can be complex. Files need to be written.Requests need to be properly fulfilled. Traffic needs to be redirected.Cross-platform process handling differs. These are a few reasons for implementing a shutdown class. If your system needs to implement functionality prior to shutdown, it's recommended for you to utilize the Shutdown.require(promise: Promise) function. When your promise resolves or rejects, shutdown can proceed as usual. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-10-06T13:42:06-06:00 using the DocStrap template. "},"Override.html":{"id":"Override.html","title":"Class: Override","body":" NodeClient Classes OverrideRequireShutdown Class: Override Override Override allows functions to be overridden. If need be, overridden functions can be, &quot;released&quot; and restored to their original state as well. new Override(originalFn, newFn, context) Parameters: Name Type Default Description originalFn String The string name of the function. This name gets eval'd to acquire the reference. newFn function null The function reference to overwrite the original with. context Object null (Optional) The context. If omitted the context is grabbed from the original function. If no context can be found, a null context is used. Methods &lt;static&gt; releaseAll() Releases all functions from their overrides. &lt;static&gt; resetAll() Resets all overrides. release() Releases the override, destroying references to the object and preventing all further overrides from occurring. reset() Resets the wrapper. set() Sets the new override function. unwrap() Unwraps a layer off the chain and then sets the function to the next chain item. wrap(newFn) Wraps the original function with the newFn. If originalFn has already been wrapped, then wraps the most recent wrapper function. Parameters: Name Type Description newFn function The new function that will always be called with the chain function as the first parameter. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-10-06T13:42:06-06:00 using the DocStrap template. "},"Require.html":{"id":"Require.html","title":"Class: Require","body":" NodeClient Classes OverrideRequireShutdown Class: Require Require Provides helpers for overriding the require function. This includes requiring from child/parent modules and all new require calls. Virtualizes CommonJS packages. Allows files to be specified that are not present in the filesystem. new Require() To Do: For security reasons, allow a sandboxed version of this code that destroys accessible references to the original require function. This prevents the case whereby 'fs', 'http', and 'https' should be overridden without a way to access their defaults. Members overrides :Object JavaScript files stored by the require token used to access it. Type: Object redirects :Object Redirection of one require token to another file or an override. Type: Object Methods deleteCache() Used by tests to reset cache. getCache(file, module) Gets the requested file from the cache, given the require object. Parameters: Name Type Description file String The file to attempt to retrieve. module Object The object. Returns: The module. Type Object getRedirect() Resolves a redirect as the redirect or the override. If no redirect or override is found, then returns the string as-is. Returns: The resolved require string token or the overridden file contents. Type String hasOverride(file) Checks if the specified file has an override. Parameters: Name Type Description file String The file to check. Returns: Type Boolean hasRedirect() Returns: True if there's a redirect. Type Boolean isCwd() To Do: This function seems to be incorrectly labeled. It returns a filename for overrides/redirects only. Returns: False if not part of CWD, else returns absolute path. Type Boolean | String isRelative(file) Function used to check incoming require requests. Parameters: Name Type Description file String The filename to check. Returns: True if the path is relative. Type Boolean modifyPaths() Updates the paths of the module after resolution. newModule(from, file) Instantiates a new module. Parameters: Name Type Description from Module The module from which to instantiate. file String The filename. Returns: A quasi Module object. Type Module normalize() Normalizes the file name. override(file, contents, isPackagePath) Overrides the function with contents to be wrapped and execute in a CommonJS module context. It's important to note that the only paths stored as overrides are absolute paths. Synonyms are created as a redirect. Parameters: Name Type Default Description file String The file to override. If is relative path, is resolved as abs path. contents String The contents of the file. isPackagePath Boolean false If true, then resolves the pathname as part of the most relevant node_modules folder. This would make the override similar as though the file specified is a package. If true this preserves the original file specified as a redirect, just as a node_modules package can be required with the package name token. redirect(from, to, isPackagePath) Redirects a require call to another redirect, override or real file. Parameters: Name Type Default Description from String The source require call to override. to String The file to redirect to. isPackagePath Boolean false If true, adds an additional redirect for the node_modules folder. To Do: The isPackagePath code path might create a redundancy if override already exists. release() Restores the original require function. require(file, parentModule) Overriden require function. Receives additional parameter of the old require function as a fallback as well as the module object. Parameters: Name Type Description file String The file to require. parentModule Module The parent module. Used to instantiate the new module object. This preserves the parent module chain. Returns: The exports object. Type Object requireNative() Requires using the native require function. requireWithoutOverride() Requires without the override. Attempts to use the custom require function, and if that does not work falls back to the native require. requireWithOverride(file, parentModule) Requires a file given a specified override. The override itself specifies the content of the file to load. Parameters: Name Type Description file String The file to require. parentModule Module The parent module. Used to instantiate the new module object. setCache() Sets the cache item. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-10-06T13:42:06-06:00 using the DocStrap template. "},"Shutdown.html":{"id":"Shutdown.html","title":"Class: Shutdown","body":" NodeClient Classes OverrideRequireShutdown Class: Shutdown Shutdown Handles shutdown events within the system. This ensures the system has the necessary time to perform cleanups before exiting. new Shutdown() Methods &lt;static&gt; clear() Clears all the steps needed to shutdown. &lt;static&gt; hook() Hooks the shutdown event. &lt;static&gt; require(fn) Requires the promise to be fulfilled before shutdown. It is not recommended to reject a promise since this will prevent other shutdown sequences from occurring. Parameters: Name Type Description fn function A function that is run when shutdown is started. Function may return a promise if asynchronous operations are needed. Promise should resolve when the shutdown function has completed. If error occurs, return {err: 'Message'} format or reject the returned promise. &lt;static&gt; start(debug) Starts the shutdown promise, waiting for all required promises to be resolved or rejected. Parameters: Name Type Default Description debug Boolean false If true, does not actually exit the process. × Search results Close Documentation generated by JSDoc 3.5.5 on 2018-10-06T13:42:06-06:00 using the DocStrap template.
