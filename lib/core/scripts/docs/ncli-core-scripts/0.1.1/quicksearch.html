"},"index.html":{"id":"index.html","title":"Index","body":" NodeClient Classes Scripts ncli-core-scripts 0.1.1 ScriptsManage tasks for large multi-package projects. Scripts can be called without changing directories. Distribute multipackage package (i.e. multiple packages in subdirectories) and cleanly have lifecycle scripts run. Overrides and configuration are available for edge cases. InstallationGlobal InstallationIf you install globally, this is more desirable on some systems to access the ncli command which allows you to interface with the task runner. Local InstallationFor local installations, some systems like Windows require you to type ./node_modules/.bin/ncli to acccess the task runner. Example UsageFrom the command-line, you should have access to the ncli executable. You can run a script either listed in the package.json file or in the scripts subdirectory. To do this, simply run ncli scriptName. require('ncli-core-scripts') returns the Scripts object. If a script is passed into the command-line, then it is executed. You may also execute a script as follows with the Scripts object: require('ncli-core-scripts').execute('scriptName');. How To: Pass Arguments to ScriptsGenerally, you are able to pass arguments to via npm run-script if you use the special -- --arg=value format, where -- notes the end of arguments and all arguments following -- are passed directly to the script. For example, consider: ncli someScript -- --foo=bar --a=123 This will call someScript inside somePackage and pass the arguemnts foo=bar and a=123 into the someScript execution. CLI APIThere are multiple methods of calling scripts. In general, one or more scripts may be called. Scripts may be called specific to a package, or wildcards may be used to match one or more scripts or packages. Arguments can be passed into a script. Name Description Examples Simple Call a single script across all packages. ncli someScript ./node_modules/.bin/ncli someScript Scoped Call a single script across a single package. ncli somePackage/someScript Scoped With Wildcards Call a single script across a packages matching the wildcard. ncli ncli-core/someScript Simple With Arguments Call a single script across multiple packages with arguments. ncli someScript -- --foo=bar Scoped With Arguments Call a single script across a single package with arguments. ncli somePackage/someScript -- --foo=bar Multiple Scripts Call multiple scripts across a single and scoped packages. ncli somePackage/someScript anotherScript foo/bar Dependencies Name Description minimist Reads arguments from command-line. ncli-core-configs Allows configuration. ncli-core-files Reads from the scripts folder. Install BehaviorCreates a scripts folder in the installation directory. Installs the ncli executable to the ./node_modules/.bin directory. require('ncli-core-scripts') BehaviorReturns an object of Scripts. Executes any command-line scripts. Index src/core/packages/scripts/bin/ncli.js Takes input module/script to run, where script is resolved as a file in the scripts folder. Index src/core/packages/scripts/index.js Takes input module/script to run, where script is resolved as a file in the scripts folder. Index src/core/packages/scripts/scripts/postinstall.js Should add the necessary script boilerplate to node_modules/.bin folder.

"},"Scripts.html":{"id":"Scripts.html","title":"Class: Scripts","body":" NodeClient Classes Scripts Class: Scripts Scripts Class transposes files from scripts/* path and adds them to active package.json on installation. Scripts may have the same name. Lifecycle scripts are run through this package and then initiated on other packages. As a result, lifecycle script execution order is maintained. If you need to maintain dependency chain order for lifecycle scripts, it's recommended to utilize NPM hooks directly. Set the `ignoreLifecycleScripts` to include an entry either with the packageName or with the package/script format. new Scripts() Members scripts :Object.&lt;String, Object&gt; Object of script names and file paths, keyed by module. Type: Object.&lt;String, Object&gt; Methods &lt;static&gt; isLifecycleScript() Returns true if is a lifecycle script. If true, usually implies a script is to be added as part of a default behavior. execute(script, packageName, ignoreNodeModules) Given a module/script format, executes the script. If no module is provided, executes the given script across all modules. Parameters: Name Type Default Description script String The script name to execute. packageName String The package name to scope execution to. ignoreNodeModules Boolean true If true, only pulls scripts from non-node_modules folders. Returns: A promise that resolves when all executed scripts have completed successfully, and rejects when one or more scripts have failed. Type Promise executeScript(modulePath, args, dir) Executes a script given a specific module path and arguments to pass into a forked process. Parameters: Name Type Description modulePath String The path to execute when forking Node.js process. args * Arguments to pass into the script. dir String The directory to execute under. Returns: A promise that resolves when the process correctly executes and closes. Type Promise getScripts() Gets all the scripts. Returns: Object of script names and file paths, keyed by module.
